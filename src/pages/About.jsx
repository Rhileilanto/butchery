                  <p>
                    With over 15 years of experience in the meat industry, Ann Nyambura has dedicated her life to the art of butchery. Starting as an apprentice at the age of 18, she learned the traditional techniques passed down through generations.

                  <p>
                    Ann's passion for quality meat and commitment to customer satisfaction led her to open Prime Cuts Butchery in 2008. Her expertise in meat selection, cutting techniques, and food safety ensures that every customer receives the finest products available.

                    "Quality is not just a word to us - it's our promise to every customer who walks through our doors. We treat every piece of meat with the respect it deserves, and every customer like family."
